//    Create a class in a new file in the Model folder called FeedViewModel.
//
//    Make sure it has an instance variable that stores some instance of the UserViewMode class. We need this to be able to handle user interactions with any post.
//    This class will handle database operations related to projects in the feed.
//    Functions include but are not limited to:
//    sync(), fetches new projects and data regarding the feed from the database (Firestore).
//    add(), adds new projects to feed (in the database). Also adds the project to the current user's list of projects.
